### Multi-Class Disk Distributions
An unofficial implementation of "Accurate Synthesis of Multi-Class Disk Distributions" [EG 2019]

### Structure
* ```pure_cpp```: forked from [here](https://github.com/Helios77760/ASMCDD), but remove all opengl stuff to a pure cpp version, super simple to run.
* ```simpler_cpp```: an even simpler version compared with ```pure_cpp```, still improving.
